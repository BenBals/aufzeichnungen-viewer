# aufzeichungen-viewer

This is a simple viewer for browsing the files in [haschis/aufzeichungen](https://github.com/haschis/aufzeichungen). It currently shows you the directories and files in the master branch of the repo. Clicks on the dirs will load its contents into the viewer. Clicks on files will open them on GitHub. Pretty useless currently.

## Motivation
I always wanted to write a pleasant viewer for this repo (and other future ones). And I've always wanted to try [Elm](https://elm-lang.org) on something a bit more complex. This is my first expiriment with both theses objectives in mind.

## Possible future features
- [ ] better styling using elm-css by rtfeldman
- [ ] view some files directly inline (focus: markdown)
- [ ] upload pictures using your github account
- [ ] filters to adjust perspective and make text more readable
- [ ] make repo private and auth with github to view it's contents here
- [ ] column view (like in the mac finder)
- [ ] search
- [ ] mobile styling
